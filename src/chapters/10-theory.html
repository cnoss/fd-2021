        The challenge is to develop an application that tries to increase the
        user’s participation in team sports through online communities. Several
        factors play into the success of this concept. It is not possible to
        achieve this goal if the application is not properly designed. To
        achieve this, design principles of several disciplines are applied to
        achieve a user-centric solution.

  <h3>User Experience Design</h3>

  <p class="mengentext">
      The term "user experience" was first coined by Don Norman in the early
      1990s when he was working at Apple (NORMAN, 2013, P. XIII F.). User
      experience comprises all aspects of a user’s interaction with a company,
      its services, and its products. The focus and most important goal of good
      user experience is to meet the user’s needs in every aspects. Close
      cooperation is required between different disciplines, such as
      engineering, marketing, graphic design, industrial design, and interface
      design (NORMAN & NIELSEN, N.D.).

  <blockquote>
    <p>
        Good design is actually a lot harder to notice than poor design, in part
        because good designs fit our needs so well that the design is invisible,
        serving us without drawing attention to itself. Bad design, on the other
        hand, screams out its inadequacies, making itself very noticeable.

        User experience captures everything a user experiences while using a
        given product, from the visuals, the haptics, and the audio to how the
        product feels. User experience of a product comprises three primary
        factors: its look, feel, and usability (IXDF - UX DESIGN, N.D.).
      </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
      User Experience Design requires a solid understanding of the psychology
      and behavior of the user. Understanding how users perceive a product
      allows user experience designers to iterate their concepts and better
      achieve the user’s goals. According to Marc Hassenzahl and Sarah
      Diefenbach’s paper <strong>Well-being</strong>,
      <strong>Need Fulfillment</strong>, and <strong>Experience Design</strong>,
      any positive experience is based on meeting psychological needs. The
      fulfillment of psychological needs, such as competence, relatedness,
      popularity, stimulation and security, contributes to the well-being of the
      user and leads to a pleasant user experience. In experience design, these
      needs are taken as guidelines and inspiration in the design process
      (HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1).
    </p>

  <p>
      Some of these needs have already been discussed in Chapter 2.1, but in the
      following, they are considered from the perspective of emotion, while
      additional needs are addressed.
    </p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Competence</dt>
    <dd class="mengentext">
        Competence is the feeling that one’s actions are perceived as capable
        and effective instead of thinking that one is incapable and incompetent
        (HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1).
      </dd>

    <dt>Relatedness</dt>
    <dd class="mengentext">
        Relatedness is the feeling of having intimate and personal relationships
        with the people in the environment, rather than feeling lonely or
        unnoticed (HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1).
      </dd>

    <dt>Popularity</dt>
    <dd>
        Popularity is the feeling of being respected and influencing others,
        rather than feeling like a person whose advice and opinion are ignored
        (HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1).
      </dd>

    <dt>Stimulation</dt>
    <dd>
        Stimulation is the feeling of experiencing much of joy and pleasure
        instead of feeling bored and understimulated (HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH,
        2012, P. 1).
      </dd>

    <dt>Security</dt>
    <dd>
        Security is the feeling of having stability and control over one’s own
        life, rather than feeling uncertain and threatened by circumstances one
        cannot control (HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1).
      </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>
      As discussed in Chapter 2.1, the social aspect is an important factor in
      motivating people to participate in various activities. Thus, it is also
      an important factor for participation in sports. Since this thesis
      addresses the question of how online sports community apps should be
      designed to increase the user’s participation in team sports, the focus
      during the design phase is laid especially on relatedness.
    </p>

  <p>
      In the context of user experience design, needs are also called “user
      needs”. In addition to the approach of Hassenzahl and Diefenbach, other
      approaches define user needs for good user experience. Design leader
      Stephen P. Anderson, for example, developed the “User Experience Hierarchy
      of Needs” model (→ FIG. 05). Rather than focusing on the psychological
      side of the user needs, this model is based on a product’s maturity
      process. Anderson proposes that products proceed through six stages of
      maturity, during which they can grow from a purely functional product, to
      a product that is meaningful to the user (ANDERSON, 2011, P. 10F.).

    <h2 data-js-linktext>Design Methods</h2>
    <p>
        After discussing the design principles necessary for a good user
        experience, this section elaborates on specific ways to approach the
        design process.
      </p>
  </header>

  <h3>Community-Centered Design</h3>

  <p>
      It is important to provide members within a community the opportunity to
      interact with each other (PREECES, 2004, P. 3FF). According to Preece,
      developing online communities is different from designing software as
      software, once shipped, is stable and does not change until the next
      update while online communities develop and change through dynamic
      interactions. It is first and foremost a social experience that changes
      according to who is participating, the number of people involved, and the
      type of discussion that takes place (IBID., P.4). For example, the
      dynamics between new and long-established communities differ notably.
      While the software might not change drastically, social interactions will
      adapt according to the growth of the community. This social adaption is
      called “sociability” (IBID.).
    </p>

  <p>
      In many online communities, these social changes are at least as
      influential as software changes. Therefore, crucial to not only focus on
      the usability of the design but also on sociability. Therefore, knowledge
      from different disciplines such as sociology, social psychology,
      anthropology, as well as user-centered design is required (IBID.). In
      participatory community-centered design methodology (→ FIG. 07), members
      of the community are involved in the design process from the beginning. In
      community-centered design, six phases are each followed by an evaluation
      period and iterations based on the findings.
    </p>

  </figure>

  <dl class="grid-view">
    <dt>Assess the Needs of the Community</dt>
    <dd>
        The first step involves understanding the community. This means
        understanding the community’s needs. It is important to understand who
        the members of the community are and what the main purpose of the
        community is. It is about understanding for whom this community exists
        and what the participants’ habits are (PREECE, 2004, P. 4).
      </dd>

    <dt>Select a Technology Plan for Sociability</dt>
    <dd>
        After understanding the potential members of the community, it is
        important to select the technology for communication within the
        community. Suitable mediums, such as timelines, discussion boards, or
        chat areas, must be discussed and the software should be tailored to
        suit the needs of the community (PREECE, 2004, P. 4F.).
      </dd>

    <dt>Test Prototype</dt>
    <dd>
        Step three requires testing of the prototype with the potential members
        of the community. The intended software and sociability structures need
        to be validated at a basic level. This validation includes the
        representation of social policies and social interactions. For example,
        if members must complete a registration policy before joining the
        community, its comprehensibility must be ensured. In this step,
        iterative changes are made according to the user feedback (PREECE, 2004,
        P. 5).
      </dd>

    <dt>Test Sociability and Usability</dt>
    <dd>
        Step four extends the testing made in step three and focuses on
        validating the design choices for good user experience and sociability.
        The usability, user interface, and the feel of the interaction are
        tested with the user. At this stage, substantial emphasis is laid on the
        overall user experience. (PREECE, 2004, P. 5).
      </dd>

    <dt>Nurture the Community</dt>
    <dd>
        After establishing the basis for the online community, the final step
        consists of nurturing the community. It is the most important process as
        long as the community exists, since nurturing the community allows new
        members to feel welcomed and supported, thus enabling growth.
        Furthermore, the community must be well advertised, so that this growth
        can continue over a long period of time (PREECE, 2004, P. 5F.).
      </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>
      A community-centered design process is crucial to a community’s life
      cycle, as it ensures that members of respective communities are heard.
      This assurance allows the design to adapt and change based on their ideas,
      desires, and needs. Designing for online communities is iterative by
      nature and should reflect the community’s evolution (IBID., P. 6).
    </p>

  <h3>Human-Centered Design</h3>

  <p>
      A design process can be approached in numerous ways. The previously
      mentioned community-centered design process is tailored specifically
      towards online communities and how members interact with each other. The
      problem, however, is that factoring in the unanimous behavior of a large
      group may result in neglect of an individual’s personal experience with
      the product. A more personal and empathetic approach is that of
      human-centered design (HCD).
    </p>

  <p>
      HCD factors in the emotional and psychological preferences of the
      individual. According to Norman, this approach that “puts human needs,
      capabilities, and behavior first, then designs to accommodate those needs,
      capabilities, and ways of behaving” (NORMAN, 2013, P. 8). HCD puts the
      individual experience with the product first, considering the whole user
      experience (IXDF - UCD, N.D.). Norman describes HCD as a philosophy that
      starts with understanding humans and their needs and difficulties through
      observation. Since people often do not realize their own needs, it is the
      designers’ responsibility to observe and define them (NORMAN, 2013, P. 9).
    </p>

  <h3>Four different phases in HCD</h3>

        222
      </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <dl class="grid-view">
    <dt>Observation</dt>
    <dd>
        Observation is the phase in which the user’s situation and the
        underlying problem that needs to be solved are researched by the
        designers. To understand the people for whom the solution is intended,
        one must observe them in their daily lives to fully understand their
        environment, the daily problems they encounter, and their goals.
        Furthermore, the current market offer is explored to determine how the
        problem has been approached by others (NORMAN, 2013, P. 222F.).
      </dd>

    <dt>Ideation</dt>
    <dd>
        Through ideation, potential solutions for the given problem are
        explored. Based on the insights gained in the research phase, various
        ideas are accumulated to select the best solution for the given problem.
        It is important that no idea is discarded or focused on too early, as
        creative variety is the essence of ideation (NORMAN, 2013, P. 226).
      </dd>

    <dt>Prototyping</dt>
    <dd>
        After the ideas are prototyped, they become tangible so that they can be
        tested later. Since feedback is crucial in the early stages of the
        design process, prototypes contain only the core functionality of the
        product with the relevant components that need validation. Prototypes
        demonstrate the real product (NORMAN, 2013, P. 227F.).
      </dd>

    <dt>Testing</dt>
    <dd>
        Testing the prototypes with real users who correspond closely to the
        target demographic uncovers weaknesses and strengths of the concept.
        Assumptions made up to this point can be confirmed or refuted.
        Furthermore, the insights gathered throughout this phase are used to
        shape the subsequent iterations, thus improving the solution in the
        process (NORMAN, 2013, P. 228F.).
      </dd>
  </dl>
  <p>
      These four phases are repeated constantly until the solution fulfills
      potential. HCD is an iterative process in which each iteration produces
      more insight, bringing the solution closer to its goal. The result is a
      product that resonates more deeply with the target audience (NORMAN, 2013
      P. 229F.). HCD might also be called user-centered design (W3C - UCD,
      N.D.).
    </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
        Human-centered design is a philosophy, not a precise set of methods, but
        one that assumes that innovation should start by getting close to users
        and observing their activities.
      </p>
    <footer>Don Norman</footer>
  </blockquote>

  <h3>Design Thinking</h3>

  <p>
      Design thinking is a process that, similarly to HCD, is centered on the
      user. The difference, however, lies in its end goal. HCD is a creative
      approach that solves known problems by gaining a deep understanding of and
      empathy for the target demographic (IDEO, N.D.). According to Michael
      Burmester, the ultimate goal of HCD is to ensure high usability and good
      user experience with digital interfaces (BURMESTER, 2016). Design
      thinking, on the other hand, is a more general approach to innovation that
      is not restricted to digital products. It, thus, has a far wider range of
      application. According to IDEO, the end goal of design thinking is the
      creation of innovative products that allow “people [to] find the sweet
      spot of feasibility, viability and desirability while considering the real
      needs and desires of people” (IDEO, N.D.).
    </p>

  <p>
      Similar to HCD, design thinking is not to be seen as a process or system
      that must be followed in a certain way but rather as a philosophy or
      mindset for how to approach human issues (AJ&SMART, 2018). According to
      the Hasso-Plattner-Institute of Design at Stanford (d.school), design
      thinking can be divided into five phases: empathize, define, ideate,
      prototype, and test (D.SCHOOL, N.D.) (→ FIG. 08).
    </p>

  <figure>
    <img
        src="/images/design-thinking.png"
        alt="Design Thinking Process own Illustration based on D.School, N.D."
/>
  </figure>
  <dl class="grid-view">
    <dt>Empathize</dt>
    <dd>
        For the design thinking process, it is first important to gain an
        empathic understanding of the user and the problem that needs to be
        solved. Therefore, it is crucial to research the users to really
        understand their needs, their objectives, their thoughts, their
        emotions, and their struggles. This can be achieved by observing the
        user, engaging with the user, or a combination of both (D.SCHOOL, N.D.).
      </dd>

    <dt>Define</dt>
    <dd>
        The second stage is dedicated to defining the problem. This is
        accomplished by compiling information gained throughout the empathizing
        phase. This widespread information is then analyzed and synthesized to
        define the core problems of the user. Defining the problem through a
        problem statement will help during the design process to address the
        relevant problems at any given time without losing focus or straying
        from the main objective. Defining the problem is about bringing clarity
        and focus to the design process (D.SCHOOL, N.D.).
      </dd>

    <dt>Ideate</dt>
    <dd>
        After gaining a solid understanding of the users and their problems,
        potential ideas for the identified problems are explored. Ideation is
        about pushing for the widest possible range of ideas to select the best
        solution for the given problem (D.SCHOOL, N.D.).
      </dd>

    <dt>Prototype</dt>
    <dd>
        Prototyping involves experimentation and turning ideas into tangible
        products. A prototype is a scaled-down version of a product that
        incorporates the potential solutions identified in the previous stages.
        Prototypes are created to communicate ideas to users (D.SCHOOL, N.D.).
      </dd>

    <dt>Test</dt>
    <dd>
        Testing the prototypes allows the designers to gain valuable feedback
        from real users. It is also another opportunity to understand the user,
        but unlike the initial empathize phase, the insights gained from the
        preceding phases facilitate a deeper and more realistic understanding of
        the user. This newfound empathy and knowledge can be used in subsequent
        iterations to refine a product to its maximum potential (D.SCHOOL,
        N.D.).
      </dd>
  </dl>
  <p>
      For the concept of this thesis, design thinking will be applied to find a
      creative solution on how to support the user’s participation in team
      sports. Based on that solution, HCD will guide the design process to
      ensure high-quality user experience and usability. Furthermore, the
      principles of community-centered design will be used to emphasize
      sociability throughout the concept.
